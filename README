Directories you may be required to create:
bin                  directory to which compiled executables are saved
lib                  location of locally compiled libraries
include              location of locally compiled files to include

MS-STEM-FEM makes use of the following libraries, which must be
present on the system for which it is compiled:

  FFTW version 3.3.6 or later compiled with MPI capabilities 
     <fftw3-mpi.h>
  
  libtiff 
     <tiffio.h>

Modification of build/Makefile may be required to ensure proper library
inclusion and compiler selection.
